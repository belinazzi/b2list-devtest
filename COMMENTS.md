# **B2List - Development test comments**

This project was developed for skills test purposes.

**Language used in the project**

I used Kotlin as the main language for the following reasons:
- Interoperability with **any** Java dependency
- Clear and expressive syntax
- It is a **consolidated** language and used by large companies like Amazon, Google and Mercado Livre

**Technologies and frameworks**

- **Spring Boot:** For the rest api services
- **Graddle:** For dependency management and build actions
- **MySql:** For database persistance
- **Swagger:** For API documentation
- **Junit:** For tests (Spring Boot Test)

**Third party dependencies**
- **SimpleCpfValidator:** For CPF validation -> https://github.com/LeoColman/SimpleCpfValidator

# **Considerations**

I created this solution without a concise and concrete plan. Just to demonstrate some of my skills.
I didn't delve into security implementations and front-end as well.

# On a real project:

**Pre development**
- Detailing needs for **now** and the **future**
- Technologies and frameworks to be used
- Definition of division of tasks for the team
- Complete and solid documentation

**Development**
- Clean code analysis
- Authentication methods
- 2FA implementation
- Unit Tests
- Architeture of the code
- Dependency inspection
- Deployment with tools like Jenkins and Nexus

**Security Inspections and bugs**

It's necessary to pentest the entire solution for search exploits and any type of vulnerability.
One simple XSS or arbitrary file upload exploit can bring the company a lot of money loss and legal proceedings,
it is not acceptable and must be mitigated before the solution public deploy.

Unwanted bugs should also be documented and fixed according to their damage level. Example tool for documenting bugs and security issues : GLPI.



**Final consideration**

There is no limit and all is possible, we only need to plan and work as a team!

_**Technology never stops, and we as developers must always be on the lookout for new learnings and improving ideas.**_
